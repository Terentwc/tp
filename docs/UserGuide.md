--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

This section walks you through the essential commands for managing your employee records ‚Äî from adding new hires to updating details or removing old entries.

Whether you‚Äôre onboarding someone, searching through your team list, or making quick edits, these commands help you get it done fast ‚Äî all from the command line.

You‚Äôll also find helpful notes below on how to format your commands, including optional fields, parameter order, and best practices.

All commands are **Case sensitive** and must be entered exactly as shown.

---

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

<br>**:information_source: How to Read the Command Formats**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholders ‚Äî you replace them with actual data.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` -> `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã can appear multiple times or not at all.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameter order doesn‚Äôt matter.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: Tip:
bd/ stands for birthday, and wa/ stands for work anniversary ‚Äî these are standard anniversaries the app automatically creates for you when you provide a date.

If you wish to track other types of anniversaries, you can add them using the [add anniversary command below](#add-anniversaries-addanni).
bd/ stands for birthday and wa/ stands for work anniversary.
</div>

---
### Listing all employees: `list`

Edits an existing employee in H'Reers.

Format: `edit Employee_ID_prefix [n/NAME] [eid/EMPLOYEE_ID] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [jp/JOB] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

* Edits the specified employee. The Employee ID can be shortened down and not necessarily needed to type in the full ID. The Employee ID prefix **must be Unique.**
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the employee will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the employee‚Äôs tags by typing `t/` without

* If data has been changed: `Undo successful!`
* No data changed: `No undo available!`

Examples:
* `undo` Will return the previous changed saved data.
* `undo 2` Will still return to the previous changed saved data as `undo` ignores all parameters after it.

---
### Locating employees: `find`

Finds employees whose names or/and job positions contain any of the given keywords.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can use this format in 3 ways!
</div>

Format 1 (Searching for name): `find n/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format 2 (Searching for job positions): `find jp/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format 3 (Searching for both name and job positions): `find n/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] jp/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* [For **Job Positions**] Only full words will be matched e.g. `Mana` will not match `Manager`
* [For **Name**] Partial words can be matched e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the find command:**<br>

* When you search within a single field (like n/ for name or jp/ for job position), you only need one of the keywords to match ‚Äî it's an OR search.

    * For example: find `n/Hans Bo` will find anyone with "Hans" or "Bo" in their name, like `Hans Gruber` or `Bo Yang`.

* When you use multiple fields together, the command finds people who match all of them ‚Äî it becomes an AND search.

    * For example: `find n/Hans jp/engineer` finds people whose name includes "Hans" and whose job position includes "engineer".

* In the case of multiple fields and keywords, you will only see a employee on the list if they match at least one keyword from each field.

    * So `find n/Hans Bo jp/dev manager` finds people whose name contains "Hans" or "Bo", and whose job position has the word "dev" or "manager".
</div>

Examples:
* `find n/li` returns `David Li` and `Real Li`
* `find n/david Li` returns `David Li` and `Real Li`
* `find n/li ri jp/ dev manager` returns `David Li`, `Real Ri` and `Real Li`<br>


![result for 'find n/li ri jp/ dev manager'](images/FindLiRiDevManagerResult.png)

---
### Deleting an employee: `delete`

Deletes the specified employee from H'Reers.

Format: `delete Employee_ID_prefix`

* Deletes the employee of the specified Employee ID.
* The Employee ID **must be valid and unique**

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete Employee_ID_prefix` deletes the specified employee.

---
## Anniversary Commands

---

### Adding Anniversaries: `addAnni`
Adds an anniversary to an employee's record in the Hreers application.
This command can create custom Anniversaries that were otherwise not supported within the `add` Command.
As the application's purpose is to keep track of **upcoming** anniversaries, it is allows the addition of anniversaries that are in the future.
As a precautionary measure against deliberate attacks to the system, certain words, such as `drop` or other backspace characters are disallowed for anniversary names or types.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can use this format in 3 ways!
</div>

Format 1 : default format for **custom** anniversaries
``` plaintext
addAnni eid/EMPLOYEE_ID_PREFIX d/DATE an/ANNIVERSARY_NAME at/ANNIVERSARY_TYPE [ad/DESCRIPTION] [atdesc/TYPE_DESCRIPTION]
```
Format 2 : short form support for Birthdays
``` plaintext
addAnni eid/EMPLOYEE_ID_PREFIX n/name bd/DATE
```
Format 3 : short form support for Work Anniversaries
``` plaintext
addAnni eid/EMPLOYEE_ID_PREFIX n/name wa/DATE
```
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the addAnni command:**<br>

* When you put duplicated options , such as `eid\abcde eid\bcde`, the prefix value that occurs last (right) `eid\bcde` is used.

    * For example : `addAnni an/Hans' Wedding an/Hans' birthday` will use `Hans' birthday`. 

* When you try to mix the different formats together, they will fail.

    * For example: `addAnni an/Hans' Birthday at/Birthday bd/2025-04-25`, this will fail.

* Unlike `add` which allows the attachment of work anniversaries and birthday together, addAnni does **not** support this feature.
* For dates, only the following format `YYYY-MM-DD` is supported as input. other date formats will fail
* Inputs such as `an/      at/      atdesc/...` will fail.
* In exceptional cases, as a mitigation for corrupted files, there may be a case where name can be filled via the anniversary type. However, this is only present as a fallback for internal features.
* **Duplicate** anniversaries are not possible. If there exist an identical entry (case-sensitive), an error will show.
* there can be multiple birthdays and work anniversaries added. this is a valid design choice, used to accomodate for next-of-kin's birthday. There is no limit to how many, but do use sparingly
</div>

Examples :
```plaintext
addAnni eid/0c2414da d/2025-03-13 an/Silver Wedding at/Wedding ad/Celebrating 25 years atdesc/Personal
```
- `addAnni` - the addAnniversary command you are running
- `eid/0c2414da`: the Employee Id prefix of the employee you are trying to attach the anniversary to
- `d/2025-03-13`: the date of the anniversary on `2025-03-13`
- `an/Silver Wedding`: the name of the anniversary `Silver Wedding`

- `ad/Celebrating 25 years` :  The description of the anniversary - `Celebrating 25 years` (optional)
- `atdesc/Personal`: The description of the anniversary type -`Personal` (optional)

If exactly one employee‚Äôs ID starts with `0c2414da`, this will create a `Silver Wedding` anniversary of the type `Wedding` for that employee, with an optional description and additional type descriptors.

```plaintext
addAnni eid/0c2414da n/Alex shenanigans bd/2025-03-13
```
- `addAnni` - the addAnniversary command declaration
- `eid/0c2414da`: the Employee Id prefix of the employee you are trying to attach the anniversary to
- `n/Alex shenanigans`: the name of the person you are attaching the birthday to (note that it is **strongly** recommended to use the name of the person the employee id belongs, unless otherwise needed)
- `bd/2025-03-13`: the date of the anniversary on `2025-03-13`
If exactly one employee‚Äôs ID starts with `0c2414da`, this will create a `birthday` (anniversary) with the Persons' `name` specified in the command.

```plaintext
addAnni eid/0c2414da n/Alex shenanigans wa/2025-03-13
```
- `addAnni` - the addAnniversary command declaration
- `eid/0c2414da`: the Employee Id prefix of the employee you are trying to attach the anniversary to
- `n/Alex shenanigans`: the name of the person you are attaching the birthday to (note that it is **strongly** recommended to use the name of the person the employee id belongs, unless otherwise needed)
- `wa/2025-03-13`: the date of the anniversary on `2025-03-13`
If exactly one employee‚Äôs ID starts with `0c2414da`, this will create a `work anniversary` with the Persons' `name` specified in the command.

### Showing anniversaries: `showAnni`

You can use this command to view all anniversaries linked to a specific employee, based on their Employee ID.

Format: `showAnni eid/Employee_ID`

What will you see:

* A new window will open showing the employee‚Äôs anniversaries.
* You‚Äôll see details like the date, name, and description of each anniversary.
* If you‚Äôre new to the app, you can also use the button in the GUI to do the same thing.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The Employee ID is the unique identifier assigned to each employee in H'Reers ‚Äî either one you provided when adding them, or one that was auto-generated.
</div>

Examples:
* showAnni eid/e22e5292-0353-49a9-9281-5a76e53bc94f

---
### Deleting Anniversaries: `deleteAnni`

order within the Employee's list of anniversaries.
If successful, the chosen anniversary will no longer appear in that employee‚Äôs list of anniversaries.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the deleteAnni command:**<br>
* deleteAnni **cannot** be undone via `undo`. so be very very careful
* When you put duplicated options , such as `eid\abcde eid\bcde`, the prefix value that occurs last (right) `eid\bcde` is used.

    * For example : `addAnni eid/... ai/1' ai/2` will use `2` as the index parameter.

* When the `eid/...` is not specific enough and there exists multiple people, the command will fail. Should this case occur, type a few more letters matching the EmployeeID in.

* When there are **NO** matching employees, this will throw an error.
* When the index specified is **out of bounds** of the anniversary list attached to the employee, the command will fail
* The index of the anniversary is where the anniversary is located when seen via the `showAnni`.
</div>

Format:
```plaintext 
deleteAnniversary eid/EMPLOYEE_ID ai/INDEX
```

Examples:
```plaintext
deleteAnniversary eid/0c2414da ai/1
```
- `deleteAnniversary` - the command you are running
- `eid/0c2414da`: the Employee Id prefix you are attaching the anniversary to
- `ai/1`: the index of the anniversary you want to delete
this will delete the anniversary at index 1 of the employee with the Employee ID prefix `0c2414da`.

#### Options Summary

| **Prefix** | **Meaning**                                                   | **Required?** | **Example**  |

### **Example Usage**
```plaintext
import ft/json fp/data/ fn/contacts wm/append
```
Explanation:
`import` ‚Äî the command you're running
`ft/json` ‚Äî file type is JSON
`fp/data/` ‚Äî file path is the data/ directory
`fn/contacts` ‚Äî file name is contacts (without extension)
this will import the file `contacts.json` from `/data` directory and append the data to the current Hreers application.

```plaintext
import ft/json fp/data/ fn/contacts wm/overwrite
```
Explanation:
`import` ‚Äî the command you're running
`ft/json` ‚Äî file type is JSON
`fp/data/` ‚Äî file path is the data/ directory
`fn/contacts` ‚Äî file name is contacts (without extension)
this will import the file `contacts.json` from `/data` directory and **overwrite** the data to the current Hreers application.

```plaintext
import ft/csv fp/data/contacts.csv wm/append
```
Explanation:
`import` ‚Äî the command you're running
`ft/csv` ‚Äî file type is CSV
`fp/data/contacts.csv` ‚Äî file path is the data/ directory
this will import the file `contacts.csv` from `/data` directory and append the data to the current Hreers application.

<summary>Advanced command rules</summary>

1. **File Type Validation**
    - Supported only `json` or `csv`.

2. **File Path & Filename Usage**
    - You can provide a complete file path with extension via `fp/`.
    - If you also supply `fn/`, ensure `fp/` is just a directory (or the import will fail).

3. **Write Mode**
    - `append` merges new records but skips conflicts.
    - `overwrite` clears existing data entirely before importing.

4. **Extension Enforcement**
    - If you use `fn/` without an extension, the system may automatically append `.json` or `.csv` based on `ft/`.
    - Mismatched extensions will raise an error.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Common Errors & Messages</summary>

- **`Invalid file type`**
  Provide either `json` or `csv` in `ft/`.

- **`Write mode must be specified as either 'append' or 'overwrite'`**
  Ensure `wm/` is one of the two valid modes.

- **`Provide either a full file path or a filename, not both`**
  This occurs if you pass `fp/` that includes a filename and also use `fn/`.

- **`Filename must be provided if path is just a directory`**
  If `fp/` is a directory, you must specify a filename (`fn/`).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tips</summary>

- **Check Extension Conflicts**: If your file says `.json` but you specify `ft/csv`, it will fail.
- **Ensure Proper Permissions**: The path must be writable or readable for the import to succeed.
- **Use Overwrite Cautiously**: This mode replaces all current data, so confirm backups if needed.

### Exporting data: `export`
saves the currently visible list of people in the Hreers application to a file (JSON or CSV).


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the export command:**<br>
* If you provide a specific directory path (`fp/`), the system will export the file there. 
* You must specify either `json` or `csv` using `ft/`
* If you also include a file name (`fn/`), any missing extension is automatically appended based on the file type (`ft/`) chosen 
    * For example, If you use `fn/contacts` but `ft/json`, the resulting file is `contacts.json`.     
* This means that you do **not** need to include the extension behind the file name.
* If you do not provide (`fp/`), the default export location will be where the `jar` file is located.
* If you specify a full file path including file name at `fp`, do not use `fn/` together.
    * For example, do not do `fp/data/output.json fn/output`
* For CSV based inputs, an employee entry with multiple Anniversaries will be duplicated to multiple rows with same employeeId and same details(name, job position, phone number, email), but each row having different anniversaries
* If the current list of displayed people is empty, export fails with an error.
* Mismatched file types or inaccessible folders will cause an error.

</div>

Format
```plaintext
export ft/FILE_TYPE [fp/FILE_PATH] [fn/FILE_NAME]
```

### **Example Usage**
```plaintext
export ft/json fp/data/ fn/contacts
```
Explanation:
`export` ‚Äî the command you're running
`ft/json` ‚Äî file type is JSON
`fp/data/` ‚Äî file path is the data/ directory
`fn/contacts` ‚Äî file name is contacts (without extension)

This will save your current contact list as a file named contacts.json in the data/ folder.

```plaintext
export ft/csv fp/data/contacts.csv
```
Explanation:
`export` ‚Äî the command you're running
`ft/csv` ‚Äî file type is CSV
`fp/data/contacts.csv` ‚Äî file path is the data/ directory and the file name is contacts.csv - note that if you want to define the file within the file path, you have to ensure that the file type matches the extension of your file. so `contaacts.json` when set to csv will give you an error

This will save your current contact list as a file named contacts.csv in the data/ folder.

```plaintext
export ft/json fp/data/ fn/contacts
```
Explanation:
`export` ‚Äî the command you're running
`ft/json` ‚Äî file type is JSON
`fp/data/` ‚Äî file path is the data/ directory
`fn/contacts` ‚Äî file name is contacts (without extension)

This will save your current contact list as a file named contacts.json in the data/ folder.

```plaintext
export ft/json
```
Explanation:
`export` ‚Äî the command you're running
`ft/json` ‚Äî file type is JSON

This will save your current contact list as a file named `output.json` in the folder where the jar is stored.
As a convenience, on the in-app output, it will show how many employees have been saved.

## Frequently asked questions and Troubleshooting
We know that even the smoothest apps can have a few bumps along the way. This section is here to help you solve common problems and answer questions that come up often ‚Äî no tech expertise required.

Whether you're setting up H'Reers on a new machine or wondering why the help window isn't showing up, we‚Äôve got you covered.

### FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous H'Reers home folder.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
